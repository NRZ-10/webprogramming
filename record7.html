<p>A CSS type selector matches all elements of a given type in a document, using the element's HTML tag name. It is also known as an element selector or tag selector, and it's used to apply styles consistently to all instances of that HTML element, such as making all <b>h1</b> headings the same color or font.</p>

<p id="id">The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.</p>

<p class="class">The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.</p>
