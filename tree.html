<p>A tree is a large plant with a strong trunk, branches, and leaves that provide shade and fresh air. Trees play an important role in maintaining the balance of nature by producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide. They give shelter to birds, animals, and insects, making them an essential part of ecosystems. Trees also prevent soil erosion by holding the soil together with their roots. They provide us with fruits, wood, medicines, and many other useful products. Trees help in bringing rain and keeping the environment cool. They reduce air pollution and act as natural air purifiers. People often rest under trees to feel relaxed and refreshed. Planting more trees is important to fight global warming and climate change. Thus, trees are a true friend of human beings and must be protected.
